   Look at the contents of the <A href="mystyle.css.txt">mystyle.css</A>
	(I copied the contents of mystyle.css into a file mystyle.css.txt
	so that your browser can read it, as some browsers have
	trouble displaying a css file directly.)
   Then look at the HTML source of this file (use your browser
   titlebar menu selection View, then Source).
